<i>This is a write up of work in progress talk I gave at the <a href="http://webdeldn.rocks">WebdeLDN meetup</a> last year.</i>

I read a book one time called 'Refactoring your wetware'. There was an
interesting part about thinking about a problem as if you were looking at it
from 10 thousand feet up in the air. 

I was driving in Sunday morning traffic one time. I was on my way from San
Francisco to a flea market. The GPS in my car told me there was an exit coming
up I should take and that I should get into one of the two lanes on the right.
About a dozen blinkers turned on at the exact same time and cars started to
merge into the right two lanes. From 10k feet up i bet that looks pretty wild.
You hear an automated voice. All cars put on their blinker at the same time to
break off from the highway to head to the same destination. 


*Two completely different view points*

I'm here to talk about Design systems, Css, Js and of course Css in Js.
And what does that look like if we as a community try to think at 10,000 feet?

When I say 10,000 feet I don't just mean think abstractly. I mean actually do
it.  You should visualize yourself being far above something. But what is the
thing?  One thing I meditate on is looking at a timeline of history from very
far away. And if we look at a timeline of how humans have designed and built
things throughout history...how do the problems and the process in which we
solve them evolve? Particularly since we started styling digital ui with css?  

A guy I collaborate with that goes by the name John Otander [(@johno)](https://github.com/johno) is pretty
good at thinking at 10,000 feet. He comes up with *wild* ideas. Last year he decided to
download the css for top million websites, in 1 month intervals, dating back to
2005 (if available).

My first thought was - that's pretty neat. We can show people their css graphed
out over time.

You can learn a bunch just by analyzing your own site.  *But, what does it look
like to see this at 10,000 feet?*

[Ask Audience]
What do you think you could learn by analyzing this data? What kind of tools could you build with it?

Some possibilities that come to mind for me:
- Can analyze values and look for trends
- Find most common property value rules for given components with common class names
- Identify pattern outliers
- Find common mistakes and try to build automated tools to solve them
- Could overlay other data: Browser usage, timeline of introduction of various technologies (frameworks, addiitons to the spec, etc.)
- We can visualize the history of design systems. We can animate them and watch how they evolve over time! 
- Given an array of urls, you could visualize the intersection of common values
  for things like: type scale, colors, background colors, font-family. This can
  help show how consistently your brand is implmented across a number of
  different front-end code bases. Most companies have different code bases
  for: their marketing site, their blog, their app, docs, external status
  page, and potentially a number of other micro sites. Having a feedback
  loop of common values can be helpful when trying to standardize an
  existing palette, or creating a feedback loop moving forward to see if you
  are becoming more or less consistent.

[Harley Turan](https://twitter.com/hturan), scraped a bunch of data and did exactly this. Here is a collection of color 
palettes pulled from multiple sites that belong to the same company visualized from 2009 through 2017.

<img src='https://github.com/mrmrs/component-api-talk/blob/master/slides/colors-time.gif?raw=true' />

Now those are just a few half-baked ideas around what you can do to analyze static
files. And I'd love to do nothing else then to sit and chat about what we can do with
all of this data but that's a different story for a different time. 

Below is a list of css properties. I often think of css as the styling api for
html. At first glance it's a lot of stuff. Especially if you're a beginner. 

But you can build a lot of pretty neat UI without worrying about a lot of these
properties and how they work. When I am a beginner one of the most difficult
things is figuring out what *to* worry about and what *not to*. I can confidently
say, when styling a button, I've never needed to set caption-side. Or
counter-increment, counter-reset, or volume for that matter. This doesn't mean you
should never use them, but they aren't common properties attached to button
styles.

Can we use this pattern to potentially make front-end code more accessible for new people? 

Components could, essentially have all of the necessary visual styling properties
exposed, where a designer can configure the values they want to pass in.

Instead of a blank slate, they could discover common things to account for
within different components. The pseudo state :focus would be a tough thing to
intuitively account for if you've never worked on the web before.  Offering it
in configuration can at the very least, offer guidance around what to research.

Some people have told me that Component Styling API is a horrible name for this
concept and they're likely correct. But I haven't come up with a better name
yet, so please let me know if you've got some ideas. I do think the following
descriptions, from a website called wikipedia, are interesting to consider.

*API: Application programming interface*
> "In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components."
> "By abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs, an API simplifies programming."
> "Thus, the design of an API attempts to provide only the tools a user would expect."

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)

When I'm styling a button, I don't expect to use volume. Or page-break. Or a
number of other properties. The goal though is not to eliminate options, it's
to narrow focus on the essential, allowing for expansion and exploration if
necessary. But this idea defining a component API has benefits extending beyond
this. 

The most influential tip on how to think about designing a component I've ever
seen is from Nicole Sullivan's excellent article [The media object saves
hundreds of lines of
code](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/)

> "When Iâ€™m building a new object, the first thing I do is to figure out which parts are reusable components, and define what I know and do not know about them."
> "For example: Can be nested, Optional right button, Must clearfix"
- [Nicole Sullivan](http://stubbornella.org)

I can't recommend this process for designing and developing components enough.
One of the things I like about react and css in js, is that it's easy to work
within this mental model. It's helpful to actively think and sketch out what
you know and what you don't know. This can help you build components that are
more resiliant, flexible, and reusable.

So, say we defined some scales, or options to work with for the following
properties. 

#### Typography
- Font-family
- Line-height
- Type-scale
- Measure (max line length)
- Font Weights
- Text Transform

#### Layout
- Spacing
- Width

#### Theme
- Colors
- Border Widths
- Border Colors
- Border Radii
- Box Shadows
  
#### Motion
- Animation speed
- Easing Functions
- Movement patterns 

Maybe this would look something like this

```
const theme = {
  breakpoints: [
    36, 48, 64
  ],
  fontFamily:[ '"Gotham", "Avenir Next", "Proxima Nova",  "Helvetica"' ],
  fontSize: [
    12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128
  ],
  fontWeight: [ 400, 600, 700 ],
  lineHeight: [ 1, 1.25, 1.5 ],
  colors: [
    { text: "#000", bg: "#fff" },
    { text: "#374047", bg: "#f8f9f9" },
    { text: "#7f8a93", bg: "#f8f9f9" },
    { text: "#0077cc", bg: "#f8f9f9" },
    { text: "#005da0", bg: "#f8f9f9" },
    { text: "#00365d", bg: "#f8f9f9" },
    { text: "#00a243", bg: "#fff" },
  ],
  borderStyle: [ 
    'solid', 
    'double', 
    'dotted' 
  ],
  borderWidth: [ 0, 1, 2, 4 ],
  borderDirection: [
    'all', 
    'top',
    'bottom' 
  ],
  radii: [
    0, 3, 5, 17, 9999
  ],
  space: [
    0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512
  ],
  measure: [ '20em', '30em', '34em' ],
  boxShadow: [ '0 0 16px rgba(0,0,0,.2)' ],
}

export default theme
```    

Some of you might have already seen a file like this before. Maybe it was a js
file, maybe it was a sass, less, or stylus file. This is pretty boring and
there isn't anything new about it. It's just a theme.

Thinking about the previous quote by Nicole Sullivan...  What if I had to
design a button and I wanted it to use values from our design system. We could
define the styling API for a button. (People love buttons.)  Potentially, we
could define a template for a button styling API.  So we'd need to think about
which properties we *always* want exposed. I think it's safe to say that people
should be able to set the background color on a button. The default color isn't
perfect or anything. It's reasonable for a well designed interface to have buttons with
different background colors. As a section in the button API we'd also want to
declare which properties should be available to style on hover. I believe it's reasonable
to change the background color on hover. So I think that should also be a part of the
API. Returning to the base part of the button API, it would be seemingly
reasonable to be able to set the font-weight to something other than the
default. In all my years of browsing the web I've never hovered on a button and
seen the font-weight change and thought "This is so nice." My first thought is
generally "Well this must be a bug." So here we could choose to leave font-weight out of
the hover, focus, and active sections in the API. 

A generic template for a button styling API might look like this: 

```
import theme from './theme'

const buttonThemeTemplate = {

  // Typography 
  fontFamily: [ ],
  fontSize: [ ],
  fontWeight: [ ],
  textTransform: [ ],

  // Palette
  colors: [ ],
  backgroundColors: [ ],

  // Borders
  borderColors: [ ]
  borderRadius: [ ],
  borderStyle: [ ],
  borderWidth: [ ],
  borderDirections: [ ],

  // Spacing
  paddingTop: [], 
  paddingLeft: [], 
  paddingBottom: [], 
  paddingRight: [], 

  // Hover states
  hoverColor: [ ],
  hoverBg: [ ],
  hoverBoxShadow: [ ],
  hoverBorderColor: [ ],
  hoverSize: [ ],
  
  // Focus states
  focusColor: [ ],
  focusBg: [ ],
  focusBorderColor: [ ],
  focusBoxShadow: [ ],
  focusSize: [ ],

  // Focus states
  activeColor: [ ],
  activeBg: [ ],
  activeBorderColor: [ ],
  activeBoxShadow: [ ],
  activeSize: [ ],

  transitionProperty: [ ],
  transitionDuration: [ ],
  transitionTimingFunction: [ ],
}

export default buttonThemeTemplate
``` 

Then we could define what values we want to pass in. We might pass in an entire
array, declare literal values, pass in a filtered array. We have javascript. We
can do whatever we want!

```
import theme from './theme'

const buttonTheme = {
  radii: theme.radii, // Entire scale
  space: [
    // Explicit steps from the scale
    theme.space[3],
    theme.space[4],
  ],
  fontSize: theme.fontSize.slice(0,-8), // Everything but the last 8 steps in the scale
  fontFamily: theme.fontFamily[0], // An explicit step in the scale
  borderStyle: [
    theme.borderStyle[0],
    theme.borderStyle[1]
  ],
  borderWidth: theme.borderWidth,
  fontWeight: theme.fontWeight,
  colors: theme.colors,
  backgroundColors: theme.colors,

  // hover, focus, active states
  
  hoverColor: [ 
    theme.colors[0].text, 
    theme.colors[1].text 
  ],
  hoverBgColor: [ 
    theme.colors[0].bg, 
    theme.colors[0].bg 
  ],
  focusColor: [ 
    theme.colors[1].text, 
    theme.colors[1].bg 
  ],
  textTransform: ['uppercase', 'capitalized'],
  transitionProperty: ['opacity', 'color', 'background-color'],
  transitionDuration: ['.25s'],
  transitionTimingFunction: ['ease-out'],
}

export default buttonTheme
```

As a design community, we could make boilerplate config files for common ui components. 
Over time we could reinvent fewer and fewer wheels. This would allow us to go deeper on 
other areas that haven't been explored as much as button styles.

This is where I think it gets *really* interesting.

Now we have a system.
We can use combinational logic to generate all possible combinations of buttons
given the input provided by a theme file. We could also use this pattern to
create a finite state machine, and visualize transitions between any discrete
state a given component can be in.

A simple config file like this generates thousands and thousands of button designs.
Here is an example of generating avatars and buttons.

[https://examples-jchwaftrgo.now.sh](https://examples-jchwaftrgo.now.sh)

Or we can make this a finite state machine and animate between the options. You
know, if you don't like scrolling for days and days and days. (Again, animation
created & provided by the one and only Harley Turan).

*Let's step back and think at ten thousand feet again.*
- We can show how many options a design system can generate. This can be
  helpful because some people feel they might be constrained by working with
  defined scales. This can help show how varied their visual designs can still
  be. A lot of people still haven't worked with scales and as a creative person
  constraint can be scary at first.
- We can quickly identify desirable regions, which can help us quickly discover
  patterns of inputs needed for a desired output. This can expose properties
  you might want to couple together and set rules for. Sense of proportion can
  change dramatically at each end of the scale.
- Could automatically a/b test design options with real user metrics 
- Wire up options to an interface that allows for collaborative voting on which
  component variations feel most on brand. You could even hook this voting up
  to a neural network.
- One of if not the most difficult part about image classification is coming up with the training data. 
  The generated data could help train an image classifier which will in turn
  help audit existing UI on websites. Imagine being able to input a url and
  query the design with questions lke: 
  - "Show me all of the buttons." 
  - "Show me all of the orange buttons." 
  - "Show me all of the buttons that have inaccessible color combinations."

This is an exciting reality to live in. We can more quickly generate lots of design
options to test with real users. We can shorten the feedback loop around discovering
what matters and what doesn't. This is a stark contrast to our current reality, which is that 
most designs we ship have not been validated with real users. We don't design multiple options in 
parallel. We end up designing a single option that is optimized for getting stakeholder signoff in a series
of status meetings.

But at the very least this concept is exciting to me because I'm very lazy and
I don't want to design buttons anymore.
