# Essential Vim Plugins

As a designer and front-end developer I've found these plugins to be quite
wonderful for editing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. While I'm comfortable running
stock vim, I prefer to have these plugins installed as a part of my setup.

I do not have a strong preference between pathogen and vundle for package management.
I have used both - but am currently using Vundle> The thing I like about it the
most is that it always works and I've never had to think about my plugin
package manager. 

**[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)**<br />

## The List

**[Ag](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim)**<br />
My most invaluable plugin. Speeds up my ability to search for strings in both code and filenames then
step through results from my query.

**[Gundo](https://github.com/sjl/gundo.vim/)**<br />
Vim indexes your text-editing history in extremely powerful ways.
But a tree of changes with many branches can be a tough thing to visualize in your head.
This plugin exposes just how powerful vim's history is.

**[Ctrlp](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/)**<br />
Fuzzy find files quickly and easily

**[Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)**<br />
Fugitive is a wrapper for git commands. It allows you to have a more efficient git workflow
without ever leaving the comforts of vim.

**[Snipmate-plus](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate)**<br />
Save custom snippets on a per file-type basis. Modeled after snippets in textmate.

**[Html5.vim](https://github.com/othree/html5.vim)**<br />
Syntax highlighting for new HTML5 elements.

**[Vim-css3-syntax](https://github.com/hail2u/vim-css3-syntax)**<br />
Syntax highlighting for css3

**[Vim-javascript-syntax](https://github.com/jelera/vim-javascript-syntax)**<br />
Syntax highlighting for javascript

## Extras

**[Surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)**<br />
I don't currently use this - but a lot of people love it.
